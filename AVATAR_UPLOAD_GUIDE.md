- Added hidden file input for image selection
- Added upload status display area
- Implemented comprehensive JavaScript for:
  - File validation (type and size)

### Backend Changes  
**File: `server/index.js`**
- Updated S3 configuration with fallback values
- Enhanced `/api/avatar` endpoint
- Added bucket/region fallbacks: `vybchat-media` and `ap-south-1`
- Improved error handling and validation

## 📝 How to Use

### For Users:
1. **Access Profile**: Click on any user's avatar or profile button in the user list
2. **Change Your Avatar**: When viewing your own profile, click the camera (📷) button
3. **Select Image**: Choose an image file from your device (max 5MB)
4. **Upload**: The image uploads automatically and updates immediately
5. **Confirmation**: You'll see a success message when the upload completes

### For Developers:
1. **S3 Configuration**: Ensure AWS credentials are set in environment variables
2. **Fallback Values**: The app uses `vybchat-media` bucket and `ap-south-1` region as defaults
3. **Testing**: Upload functionality works with the existing S3 setup
4. **Customization**: Button styling and validation rules can be modified in the HTML file

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key

5. Select an image file and verify upload

- ✅ Successful upload with immediate UI update
- ✅ Error handling for network issues
- ✅ Cache busting for fresh avatar display

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

- **S3 Permissions**: Ensure the AWS credentials have PutObject permissions for the avatars folder
